            <h2>History of the Rubik's Cube</h2>
            <p>The Rubik's Cube was invented in 1974 by Hungarian architecture professor Ernő Rubik. Initially created as a teaching tool to help his students understand 3D objects, Rubik didn't realize he had created a puzzle until the first time he scrambled his new cube and tried to restore it. The cube was first called the "Magic Cube" in Hungary. Rubik applied for a patent in Hungary for the "Magic Cube" in 1975, and the first cubes were produced and sold by Politoys Ipari Szövetkezet in Budapest. The puzzle was licensed by Rubik to be sold by Ideal Toy Corp in 1980 and gained international popularity, becoming one of the world's best-selling toys. To date, over 350 million Rubik's Cubes have been sold worldwide, making it the best-selling toy of all time.</p>
